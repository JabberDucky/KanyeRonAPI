## Exercise1:

Letâ€™s create a console application that calls both the Ron Swanson API, and the Kanye West API. Using both APIs, make Ron Swanson and Kanye West have a conversation that prints to the console.

Hints:
Use a for loop to generate at least 5 quotes from each api and have them alternate to simulate a conversation

Here is some code to utilize for parsing the ron swanson response:
```
var ronQuote = JArray.Parse(ronResponse).ToString().Replace('[', ' ').Replace(']', ' ').Trim();
```

Here are the API urls:

https://api.kanye.rest
